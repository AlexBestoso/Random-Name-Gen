# Random-Name-Gen
please leave credit for the work done in the source code!

This was written for teachers and anyone who will find it useful.
Special thanks to chris kamps for creating the initial program design and workings and to Mrs. Awde for bringing the issue of making the name changing more user friendly to my attention.

To run in linux open the src file and run the command:

sudo java MainFrame

it's reccomended to use chmod to enable write access on the provided xml file. If you are too lazy to do that
us can use the sudo command as stated above.

This program asks you to enter in names to be shuffled and placed in a random order. names are saved to an XML file.
